Challenge 1
Create a script that examines a string for the occurrence of a particular
letter, as you did previously in this exercise for “Geographic Information
Systems.” If the letter occurs in the text ( for example, the letter Z ), the
string “Yes” should be printed to the Interactive Window. If the letter
does not occur in the text, the string “No” should be printed.
Challenge 2
Create a script that examines a list of numbers without duplicates ( for
example, 2, 8, 64, 16, 32, 4 ) and determines the second-largest number.
Challenge 3
Create a script that examines a list of numbers ( for example, 2, 8, 64,
16, 32, 4, 16, 8 ) to determine whether it contains duplicates. The script
should print a meaningful result, such as “The list provided contains
duplicate values” or “The list provided does not contain duplicate values.”
An optional addition is to remove the duplicates from the list.
Challenge 4
Consider the following list:
mylist = ["Athens", "Barcelona", "Cairo", "Florence", "Helsinki"]
Determine the results of the following:
a ) len(mylist)
b ) mylist[2]
c ) mylist[1:]
d ) mylist[-1]
e ) mylist.index("Cairo")
f ) mylist.pop(1)
g ) mylist.sort(reverse = True)
h ) mylist.append("Berlin")
These operations are all to be performed on the original list — that is, not
as a sequence of operations. Try to determine the answer manually first,
and then check your result by running the code.
